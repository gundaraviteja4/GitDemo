For reports we use extent reports
 we have added 2 dependencys of extent report in pom.xml
 
 
 To set browser from Jenkins follow below steps:
 
 In BaseClass.Java - System.getProperty() is used to get browser property from maven command.
 Goto Jenkins and Configure Section, 
 	select 'This project is parameterised'
 	select 'Add Parameter/Choice Parameter' 
 	Provide Name, example browser
 	In Choices, enter chrome,firefox,ie
 	
 	Now Goto Configuration/Build Section, In maven command provide test -Dbrowser="$browser"   // choice parameter name given in line 12 above
 	
Head less mode:
 	Which means test runs in background in browser(eg: chrome) and give results. Advantage is we can do operations on cbrowser while running tests in headless mode and test run is somewhat faster in headless mode
 	Using ChromeOptions class we can acheive headless mode, see BaseClass.java
