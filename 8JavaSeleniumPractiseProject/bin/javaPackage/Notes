Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and 
the data it manipulates.Other way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from 
being accessed by the code outside this shield.

Data members (or variables or data fields) are private which cannot be accessed directly.These fields can be accessed via public 
methods only.
