Collections(Java.util) framework uses interfaces and classes, below are the collections type

1. List has 3 classes -- all the classes which implements list interface will accept duplicate values
	Arraylist
	LinkedList
	Vector
2. Set		--	all the classes which implements set interface will not accept duplicate values, this is difference between set and list
	HashSet
	TreeSet
	LinkedHashSet
3. Map




list guarantes the order but set doesn't i.e set may return values randomly


Difference between HashMap and HashTable:

	HashMap is not Synchronized and not thread safe : that means multiple programs can rum simultaneously at a time in HashMap but in HashTable 1 program has to wait for another to complete.
	HashMap allows Null keys and Null values but HashTable doesn't allow Null keys and Null values.
	HashMap uses Iterator but HashTable uses Enumerator
